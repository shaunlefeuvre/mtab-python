# mTab Python

## Tasks

1. Create an API using the Django framework that:
   1. Accepts a string of text in the request body 
   2. Returns a UUID for the request in the response body
   3. Persists the supplied text using any method (it does not need to be durable)
2. Create a second API that:
   1. Accepts one UUID as part of the URL path
   2. Returns the number of words contained in the text (or a suitable response for an invalid ID)
3. If time, create tests that ensure the correctness of your implementation

## Notes

- You may add any third party libraries but be prepared to justify your choice
- Use Postman (or similar tool) to demonstrate the APIs are working
- You may use the internet or other tools to reference documentation
